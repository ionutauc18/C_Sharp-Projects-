# C_Sharp-Projects
This repository contains all the C# projects and assignments done during the C# and .NET Framework - Part 1 course. 
The repository contains the following Projects and Assignments:
- Writing and Running Code in C# Assignment; 
- A six-part Console Application Assignment

This is a six-part Console Application where we use a one-dimensional array of strings, loops, infinite loops, asking the user to input text to search through a list, foreach loops etc. in C#;
- A Console Application Assignment with Strings and Integers where we create a list of integers and use those integers to create mathematical operation, putting a loop in a try/catch block etc;
- A Console Application that shows a skipet of a card battle game that calls three methods, each of which will take one integer parameter in and return an integer
- A Console Application where we do different mathematical operation on a integer and return the answer as an integer, a decimal and return the answer as a integer and a string, converting it to an integer and returning the answer as an integer;
- A Console Application where we use polymorphism to create an interface called IQuittable and have it define a void method called Quit().We also have an Employee class inherit from that interface and implement the Quit() method.

-   Car Insurance
   
 This is a MVC Web Application project that mimics a car insurance website, taking user's input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. This also has an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.
